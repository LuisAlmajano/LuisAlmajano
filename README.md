### Hi there 👋 I am Luis Almajano!

My wish is to become a full stack web developer and create my own personal and maybe in the future professional projects. I am passionate about React, Node and MongoDB (MERN Stack) and cloud-based (serverless) technologies such as AWS and AWS Amplify.

⚡ According to a survey from StackOverFlow the highest percentage of respondents who consider themselves to be “hardcore developers” were between 25 and 29 years of age. This is not to say that there aren’t developers over 30 – older developers just no longer consider themselves “hardcore developers”. 

I am over 40 and started my developer journey recently. Hence, I can confirm I do not consider myself a "hardcore developer" 😄
